    <h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Empanadas are little crescent-shaped pastries from Argentina. You can hardly walk down a street in Buenos Aires without passing an empanaderia. They make a great snack - or indeed dinner to share with friends. In this recipe the empanadas are humita flavor.</p>
		<p>Humita is a corn-based recipe that is one of the most famous dishes in the gastronomy of northern Argentina, it has a filling of 'guiso andino' (Andean stew) wrapped in a 'chala'. But its consumption does not end in our country, this spectacular food is part of the gastronomy of the so-called Andean area: Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and a part of Colombia and Venezuela.</p>
		<p>The origin of the word humita is from the Quechua language Humint'a, but in other countries with a similar dish such as Venezuela it is called hallaca, in Bolivia it is called huminta closer to Quechua, in Peru it also bears the name humita and arriving in Central America it is known by the name tamale.</p>
